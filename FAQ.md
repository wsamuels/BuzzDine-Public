##How do I create an account?

When you download BuzzDine on the Appstore for the first time, you will be directed to create a profile.

##How do you differ from Instagram and other food posting social networks?

Many existing social media outlets contain pictures of food but not the entire story. Information is scattered and not consolidated in an orderly fashion the way that we do it. Our app is picture-centric. We get rid of anything we donâ€™t think you need. In other words, our goal is to provide the customer with a simplistic, yet aesthetically pleasing user interface. 

##How does the explore page work? 

The explore page offers a trending feature which shows our users the top liked pictures of food in their area. This makes it easy to find the hottest places just around the corner from you. 

##How does the feed work?

You may be wondering why the feed is empty when you download the app. The reason for this is because the feed shows you posts from users that you follow. Begin by requesting to follow users.
